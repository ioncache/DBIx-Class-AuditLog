0.4.3 - XXXX

    Fixed:
    - quote_names is removed and not enabled by default from Audit Log
    - user and timestamp in Changeset.pm are reserved words by many databases. They are renamed to user_id and created_on. In order to keep the foreign names consistent, all foreign key columns have suffix id, ex. field_id, action_id, changeset_id and etc.

    Updated:
    - Version 0.4.3 breaks backward compability, because of the changing column names. An util script is added into the utils/ directory in order to update existing database schemas.

0.4.2 - 2013/03/03

    New:
    - quote_names from DBIx::Class::Storage is now enabled by the Audit Log

    Fixed:
    - bug in the way 'order_by' was being used in get_changes method

0.4.1 - 2013/03/02

    New:
    - ability to load the AuditLog in a resultset class to enable logging when using methods acting upon an entire resultset (eg, DBIx::Class::RecursiveUpdate) -- LUKAST
    - Shared variable $DBIx::Class::AuditLog::enabled can be set to 0 to disable audit logging. This can be scoped locally so as to disable logging of a single transaction or inside a transaction to disable logging on a particular transaction action. Note: if DBIx::Class::AuditLog isn't used explicitly in the package where this variable is set, a 'used only once' warning may occur, no warnings 'once' can be set to avoid this if desierd.

    Updated:
    - audited_row in Action.pm is now a varchar(255) instead of an int to allow for multi-column or non-numeric primary keys -- LUKAST

    Fixed:
    - issue where updates were logging all fields even when they weren't changed -- LUKAST

0.3.1 - 2012/09/10

    Fixed:
    - issue where 'field = -1' was being added to get_changes queries when no field was passed in the get_changes request -- DPETROV

0.3.0 - 2012/08/31

    New:
    - new dbic column attribute 'force_audit_log_column': force the value to be logged even if it didn't change (ie, new_value = old_value) -- LUKAST
    - new dbic column attribute 'modify_audit_value': modify value of column before being stored in audit log -- LUKAST

    Fixed:
    - when passing a field to get_changes that didn't exist in the audit_log_field table all changes were being returned instead of none

0.2.6 - 2012/08/13

    New:
    - the AuditLog result classes now inherit from a base class, useful for overriding if need be -- MATTP
